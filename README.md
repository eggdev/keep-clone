# React Exercise Todo-List
We will be building a todo-list in React!

## Description
We would like to build a single page React application to manage our todo lists. The application does not require any API calls or database connection and we can store the state of our app within the current session.

Our application should contain two main views:
 - A list of todo lists: The landing view is a place that displays all of the lists we have created and has actions to create a new todo list.
 - The todo list: The view that contains the name of the list and todo items

## Requirements
- Use a static site generator: create-react-app
- Utilize state managemnt using react-redux
- Allow for direct links to a todo list
- Provide methods for adding, editing and deleting lists
- Define a few unit tests using your favorite testing framework
- Show how you check your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors
- Break up large pages and code blocks into smaller react components
- Use a UI framework
